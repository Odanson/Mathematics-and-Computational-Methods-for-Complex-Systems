# Solving systems of linear equations

Let's start with a [rhetorical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetorical_question) maths question.

!!! info "Rhetorical question"
	- I go to the market with a rucksack that can carry $5kg$ of fruit. I want to fill it. 
	- I have £12 of cash 
	- Apples are £3/kg. Bananas are £2/kg.
	How many kg of apples and bananas should I buy to use my money and fill my rucksack?

Maths questions are just wordy ways of **embedding constraints** (e.g. the constraint of having £12). To solve a question, the first step is to list the constraints mathematically:

$£3 \times 🍎 + £2 \times 🍌 = £12$
$🍎 + 🍌 = 5kg$

(where 🍌 and 🍎 represent the desired weight of each fruit, in kg)

In a more condensed form, this is:

$$\begin{align}
3&🍎 + 2🍌 &= 12 \\
1&🍎 + 1🍌 &= 5
\end{align}$$

We can write this as a matrix equation!...

#### Important points:
1. **The question above is known as a matrix equation. Or a system of linear equations**. The general form of a matrix equation is:

!!! info "General matrix equation"
	Find $x$ such that $Ax = b$, where
	-  $A$ is a **known** matrix
	-  $b$ is a **known** vector 
	-  $x$ is an **unknown** vector
	Solving the equation consists of finding $x$.

2. Most computational mathematics problems in the world boil down to solving matrix equations. **It's a really important class of problem**. 
- Interestingly, **there is no computational method that can solve really big matrix equations efficiently**. If you have a vector $x$ of length $n$, you need **more than** $n^2$ computations to solve the problem (somewhere between $n^2$ and $n^3$). If $n = 1000,000$, well.... a million squared is a large number, and a million cubed even more so!
- There's an entire field of maths devoted to slightly speeding up solutions to this problem, e.g. see [here](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-algorithm-breaks-speed-limit-for-solving-linear-equations-20210308/) for a fun news article on the topic.

## Solving by hand 
(is something you **never** need to do)

**Nevertheless**, understanding how matrix algebra works is important, so let's go through how you might do it:


### 1. What would make it an **easier** matrix problem?

- What's the easiest type of matrix equation to solve? Something like this?

$$\begin{bmatrix} 
	3 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 
	\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
	🍎 \\ 🍌
	\end{bmatrix} = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\bullet \\ \bullet
	\end{bmatrix}$$

This is a **diagonal** matrix equation. If the matrix is diagonal, the unknowns have been decoupled, so you can solve them separately! You'd get: $🍎 = \frac{\bullet}{3}$, for instance (whatever $\bullet$ is). See below for how to write a diagonal matrix in julia (using LinearAlgebra.Diagonal):

md"""
Why are upper triangular matrix problems easy to solve?

- Well, the bottom row is solved immediately, as it only involves the bottom unknown. In the example above, $🍌 = \frac{\bullet}{2}$.
- If we have solved the bottom row, then the second-bottom row is solved immediately. We know the numerical value of 🍌 (i.e. `x[end]`) from the equation of the bottom row. We can substitute this in. Then the equation for the `[end-1]` row only has one remaining unknown: x[end - 1].
- ...and so on, iteratively, until we get to the top!

"""

# ╔═╡ a9e14425-c839-4d01-835e-361d992d1aa6
md"""
### 2. How can we **turn it into** an easier matrix problem?

- We already know that
$$\begin{align}
3&🍎 + 2🍌 &= 12 \\
1&🍎 + 1🍌 &= 5
\end{align}.$$

We can **add or subtract** one equation from the other, and it won't change the solution! For instance

$$\begin{align}
2&🍎 + 1🍌 &= 7
\end{align}.$$

(by subtracting the bottom equation from the top).

The golden rule of equations is that **you can do anything to the equation, as long as you do it to both sides of the equation**. As such, we can also multiply equations by any nonzero scalar. For instance

$$\begin{align}
3*(2&🍎 + 1🍌) &= 3*7
\end{align}.$$
so

$$\begin{align}
6&🍎 + 3🍌 &= 21
\end{align}.$$

**Matrix interpretation**: We are solving * an equivalent problem with the same answer* if we perform the following **row operations**:
- add or subtract rows from each other
- **swap** rows
- Multiply rows by a nonzero scalar.



So can you see why 
 $$\begin{bmatrix} 
	2 & 2 \\ 2 & 1 
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
	🍎 \\ 🍌
	\end{bmatrix} = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
	10 \\ 7
	\end{bmatrix}$$
is the same problem?

1. If we wrote out the **usual** method of matrix multiplication, we would get:

$$b_i = \sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij}x_j$$
This is the formula for the $i^{th}$ row of $b$: $b_i$.

We can get the same result by considering $b$ as a weighted sum of the columns of $A$. Let $A_{\bullet, i}$ denote the $i^{th}$ column of $A$ (which is a vector). Then

$$b = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i A_{\bullet, i}$$.

Note that $x_i$, the $i^{th}$ element of $x$, is just a number here. 

2. This means that $b$ is in the span of the columns of $A$, as we have just written it as a weighted sum of the columns, where the numbers $x_i$ constitute the weights. 

Recall that the span of any set of vectors (i.e. the columns of $A$) forms a vector space.

3. Nonempty kernel means there is some nonzero $x$ such that $Ax = 0$. Writing this out like in question one:

$$0 = \sum_{i} x_i A_{\bullet, i}$$.

We can take one of the columns (e.g. the first) onto the left-hand-size (LHS) of this equation:

$$-x_1 A_{\bullet, 1} = \sum_{i=2}^n x_i A_{\bullet, i}$$

$$A_{\bullet, 1} = \sum_{i=2}^n -\frac{x_i}{x_1} A_{\bullet, i}.$$

But now we have written the first column as a weighted sum of the other columns! So the first column is in the span of the other columns. It is not linearly independent of them. Finished.


**Addendum**

*We showed above that removing one of the columns doesn't change the span. Therefore, the span of the columns of $A$ must form a vector space of dimension strictly less than $n$, since it's spanned with $n-1$ elements. Therefore*

$$\{b : \exists x : Ax = b \}$$ *(i.e. the range of $x$) is a lower dimensional vector subspace of dimension $n-1$ or less.*

**Harder, skip if you like**

Suppose $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, i.e. it has size $m \times n$.

First:
- If $A$ is invertible, then $\ker(A) = \{0\}$. 
- This means the columns of $A$ are linearly independent, from the question above. 
- There are $n$ columns, and they each have length $m$. This means that $m \geq n$. If $m < n$, then you've found more than $m$ linearly independent vectors in $\mathbb{R}^m$, which means the dimension of the vector space $\mathbb{R}^m$ is more than $m$, which is a contradiction.

Second:
- If $A$ is invertible, then $A^T$ is invertible, with inverse $(A^{-1})^T$. 
- $A^T$ has $n$ rows and $m$ columns. We can repeat the argument above, replacing $A$ with $A^T$. We get that $n \geq m$.

All the rows of $M$, except the first, must only contain zeros. EG 

$$M = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 4 &3 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}$$

There are many reasons $M$ can't be invertible. One is that:

We can always find a nonzero vector $x$ that is orthogonal to the first row of $M$: $M_{1, \bullet}$. (*In other words, so that the dot product $(M_{1, \bullet})^Tx = 0$.*)

- We could find such an $x$ by rotating the first row by $\pi/2$ degrees.
- Or by taking (in code) `x[1:end-1] = M[1,1:end-1]` and `x[end] = -dot(x[1:n-1], M[1, 1:end-1])`

If $x$ is orthogonal to the first row of $M$, then $Mx = 0$. The orthogonality ensures that the first element $(Mx)_1$ is the number zero. All other elements of $Mx$ are zero by the design of $M$. 

This means that $M$ has a non-trivial kernel, as $x \in \ker(M)$ and $x \neq 0$. So $M$ is non-invertible.

Now we are going to cover eigenvalues and eigenvectors. These are a really important concept!

!!! info "Definition: eigenvalues and eigenvectors"
	Consider a square matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$. $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is an **eigenvector** of $A$ if $\exists \lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $$Av = \lambda v$$. Here, $\lambda$ is known as the **eigenvalue** associated with $v$  We call $(\lambda, v)$ the eigenvalue-eigenvector pair.

Intuition: $v$ is an eigenvector if **it doesn't change direction when transformed by $A$**. In other words, applying $A$ just scales it. See 3blue1brown video at the top of the notebook.

Take any eigenvector-value pair $(\lambda, v)$, of $A$

-  $Av = \lambda v$
-  $A^{-1}Av = v$ 
- So $A^{-1}(\lambda v) = v$
- We can divide both sides of the equation by $\lambda$ by linearity. So $A^{-1}v = \lambda^{-1}v$
- Hence $(\lambda^{-1}, v)$ is an eigenvalue-vector pair of $A^{-1}$.

Overall, for any eigenvalue $\lambda$ of $A$, we get that $\lambda^{-1}$ is an eigenvalue of $A^{-1}$, and it also has the same eigenvector.

If we're being complete, we should also ask whether there could be any extra eigenvalues for $A^{-1}$, which are not inverses of eigenvalues of $A$. The answer is no. Why? 

-  $A$ is an inverse to $A^{-1}$. 
- So by the above argument, for any eigenvalue $\lambda$ of $A^{-1}$, the inverse $\lambda^{-1}$ will be an eigenvalue of $A$, with the same eigenvector.

# Matrix factorisations
(also known as matrix decompositions)

Take a matrix $M$. If we can rewrite it as the **product** of two (or more matrices), then we have **factorized** $M$. 

So for instance $M = ABC$ is a decomposition of $M$. Just like $3*4*2$ is a factorisation of $24$!

There are many matrix decompositions with long names! Cholesky, LU, QR, SVD. In fact matrix factorizations are an **abstract type** in the LinearAlgebra package. So you can see all the factorisations supported in LinearAlgebra with the code below:

md"""

What's the point of all these factorisations? Are they useful to know about or understand?

- Mostly, exotic factorisations are used to solve specific types of matrix equation (i.e. where the matrix has specific properties) more efficiently. Sometimes, they help when doing tricky matrix algebra (e.g. the Schur factorization). 

- Therefore they are **not that important** to end-users such as yourself, who are going to write ```A \ B``` to solve a matrix equation, and leave the details to the programming language. 

- It's however important to know they exist and what they amount to (i.e. what I wrote above) so that they don't sound intimidating if you do come across them!


**Also!**... 

When we are testing hypotheses in complex systems / data science research, sometimes we want to generate 'random' matrices to test our hypotheses on. Sometimes we want these random matrices to have specific properties. 

!!! info "Example"
	You've built a processing pipeline for some data represented in a matrix. EG people's exam grades for different modules. You hypothesise that there are hidden correlations, e.g. people that did well in English also do well in French. You build a customised pipeline, e.g. using something like [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) to see if this is true. 

	Does your pipeline work? Are there bugs? To check, you want to test your pipeline on different pieces of *fake, pseudo-data*, to make sure it doesn't do anything crazy. So you might want to generate 'random' matrices with fixed eigenvalues (representing correlations in the data). How?



One decomposition is often useful for situations like this, when you want to construct `random' matrices with particular properties...

- The dot product of $Q_{\bullet, i}$ and $Q_{\bullet, j}$ is the $(i,j)$ element of $Q^TQ$. And $Q^TQ = \mathbb{I}$.
- So the dot product is $1$ if $i=j$, and $0$ if $i \neq j$
- The range of $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is the entire vector space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Take any $b \in \mathbb{R}^n$. We can find an $x$ such that $Qx = b$ by taking the inverse rotation, i.e. $x = Q^Tb$. Then $QQ^T = \mathbb{I}$ so $Qx = b$.
- Yes. There are $n$ columns. Take any vector $b \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Take $x$ such that $Qx = b$. We can write $b$ as a weighted sum of the columns (see prev question), i.e.

$$b = \sum_{i=1}^n Q_{\bullet,i} x_i.$$

So $b$ is in the span of the columns of $Q$. So they span the whole vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$, as $b$ was chosen arbitrarily.

For the columns to be a basis, they have to span $\mathbb{R}^n$, and they have to be linearly independent. 

They are linearly independent. If not, we could delete one linearly independent columns without affecting the span. Then we would have $n-1$ vectors spanning $\mathbb{R}^n$. This would mean that the latter was an $n-1$ dimensional vector space, which it is not.
